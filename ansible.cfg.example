# EXAMPLE ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Update paths to match YOUR actual environment

[defaults]

# (other defaults can be set here as needed) 
scp_if_ssh = True

[ssh_connection]
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Update this path to YOUR actual project location
ssh_executable=/path/to/your/project/ansible_env/bin/python -m ansible_pylibssh.ssh
# Optionally set pipelining (can speed up connections if your devices support it)

[persistent_connection]

# CONFIGURATION NOTES:
# 1. Replace "/path/to/your/project" with your actual project directory path
# 2. Ensure the Python executable path points to your virtual environment
# 3. Adjust SSH arguments based on your network requirements
# 4. Test connectivity after making changes
